This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data using Microsoft Excel and creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the key insights. The goal is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of bike sales performance and trends.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing bike sales information, including attributes such as date of sale, bike model, customer information, sales revenue, and quantity sold. The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
   - Import the dataset into Excel.
   - Clean the data by removing any duplicates, missing values, or inconsistencies.
   - Transform and format the data as required for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Calculate summary statistics, such as total revenue, average quantity sold, and total number of sales.
   - Analyze sales trends over time using line charts or area charts.
   - Identify top-selling bike models and customer segments based on sales revenue or quantity.

3. Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts:
   - Utilize pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data by different dimensions, such as bike model, customer segment, or sales region.
   - Create pivot charts, such as bar charts or pie charts, to visualize the aggregated data and identify patterns or trends.

4. Sales Performance Metrics:
   - Calculate key performance metrics, such as total sales revenue, average revenue per sale, and revenue growth rate.
   - Analyze sales performance by different dimensions, such as time period, bike model, or sales region.

5. Dashboard Creation:
   - Design and create an interactive dashboard using Excel's features, such as slicers, pivot charts, and conditional formatting.
   - Incorporate the key insights and visualizations from the analysis into the dashboard.
   - Ensure that the dashboard provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring the data.
